**Abstract**

Low birthweight (LBW) is a risk factor of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that 4 weeks of carbohydrate overfeeding (COF) would unmask key T2D pathophysiological mechanisms among 22 non-obese LBW men, including 5 with confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), compared with 21 healthy normal birth weight (NBW) controls. Fasting hepatic fat content, hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, energy expenditure, plasma and serum biomarkers, metabolomics, and lipidomics, as well as abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) histology and transcriptomics, were measured before and after COF with 25% extra energy. 

Key words: carbohydrate overfeeding, low birthweight, hepatic fat content, hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, energy expenditure, metabolomics, lipidomics, adipose tissue morphology, RNAseq.
