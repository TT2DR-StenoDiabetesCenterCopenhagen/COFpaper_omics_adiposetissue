**Abstract**

Low birthweight (LBW) is a risk factor of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that 4 weeks of carbohydrate overfeeding (COF) would unmask key T2D pathophysiological mechanisms among 22 non-obese LBW men, including 5 with confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), compared with 21 healthy normal birth weight (NBW) controls. Fasting hepatic fat content, hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, energy expenditure, plasma and serum biomarkers, metabolomics, and lipidomics, as well as abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) histology and transcriptomics, was measured before and after COF with 25% energy. Fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, hepatic insulin resistance, and energy expenditure increased more in response to COF in LBW, including those without NAFLD, compared to NBW men (all P<0.05). While body weight increased to same extent in both groups, total body fat mass increased during COF only among NBW controls (P=0.01). Conversely, hepatic fat content adjusted for total body fat increased relatively more among LBW subjects with and without NAFLD (P<0.05). Plasma adiponectin was significantly lower (P<0.05), and together with leptin and FGF21, increased during COF only among LBW subjects. Serum alanine, as well as phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides, increased significantly more in LBW compared to NBW subjects during COF (all P<0.05). Adipocyte density (cells per area) was lower in LBW at baseline (P<0.01), and decreased after COF only among NBW subjects (P=0.02). Finally, SAT RNAseq and integrated multi-omics analyses indicated impaired PPAR-gamma signaling, increased collagen and extracellular matrix formation, as well as differential expressions of genes encoding ELOVL6, ACTG2 and CH25H, collectively supporting impaired SAT expandability to contribute to the differential metabolic responses to COF in LBW subjects with and without NAFLD.    

*Key words:* carbohydrate overfeeding, low birthweight, hepatic fat content, hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, energy expenditure, metabolomics, lipidomics, adipose tissue morphology, RNAseq.
